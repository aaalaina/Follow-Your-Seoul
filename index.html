        <h1>Take a trip to Seoul!</h1>
        <p>Annyeong haseyo! Seoul, pronounced 'Soul' to the modern western english speaker, is the capital of South Korea and largest city in the country with a population of nearly 10 million people! The name of the capital has been changed several times throughout history. It was most recently renamed Seoul in 1945 after World War 2. I chose Seoul due to the increasing international attention given to the country thanks to the k-pop scene, their cinema, their skincare, etc. From their cuisine to their beautiful landscapes and rich history, I definitely think that this is a country you don't want to look over should you decide to travel to east Asia.</p>
